# Vena ETL Tool: Next Steps

This document outlines future improvements for the Vena ETL Tool, organized by priority.

## High Priority (Critical Functionality & Security)

1. ✅ **Input Validation for Step Configuration** (COMPLETED)
   - Problem: The multi-import functionality doesn't validate if all required step inputs have matching files.
   - Solution: Added validation to check if all required inputs have files before starting the ETL job.
   - Impact: Prevents job failures mid-process and improves reliability.

2. ✅ **Add Input Sanitization** (COMPLETED)
   - Problem: User inputs like file paths and IDs aren't sanitized before use.
   - Solution: Added proper input sanitization to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
   - Impact: Critical security improvement to mitigate potential security risks.

3. ✅ **Enhance Environment Variable Validation** (COMPLETED)
   - Problem: The environment variable validation is minimal.
   - Solution: Added more robust validation with clear error messages for missing/invalid variables.
   - Impact: Improves system reliability and user experience during setup.

## Medium Priority (Functionality Enhancements)

4. ✅ **Add Retry Logic for Failed Files** (COMPLETED)
   - Problem: If a file fails to upload in multi-import, the process continues without retrying.
   - Solution: Added retry mechanism for failed files with customizable retry count and backoff timing.
   - Impact: Improves reliability without requiring manual intervention.

5. **Add CSV Headers Validation** (ON HOLD pending final CSV file format)
   - Problem: Currently, CSV files are validated for existence and extension, but not for content structure.
   - Solution: Add optional validation for CSV headers against template requirements.
   - Impact: Prevents data import failures due to malformed files.

6. ✅ **Centralize Response Handling** (COMPLETED)
   - Problem: The code has similar response handling patterns repeated in multiple places.
   - Solution: Created a centralized response handler that's reused across API calls.
   - Impact: Reduces code duplication and improves consistency.

## Lower Priority (User Experience & Code Quality)

7. ✅ **Add Progress Tracking** (COMPLETED)
   - Problem: When uploading multiple files, there's no progress indicator.
   - Solution: Implemented a streaming upload system with real-time progress tracking.
   - Impact: Dramatically improves user experience and memory efficiency for large file uploads.

8. ✅ **Implement Streaming File Upload** (COMPLETED)
   - Problem: Previous implementation loaded entire files into memory causing potential OOM issues with large files.
   - Solution: Implemented a streaming upload approach with:
     - Backpressure handling for memory management
     - Robust error handling and recovery
     - Race condition prevention between events
     - Cleanup of resources to prevent memory leaks
   - Impact: Enables reliable uploads of files of any size while maintaining memory efficiency.

9. ✅ **Enhance Streaming Upload Reliability** (COMPLETED)
   - Problem: Basic streaming implementation needed additional resilience for various network conditions.
   - Solution: Implemented advanced streaming features:
     - Adaptive backpressure that adjusts based on historical upload rates
     - Stall detection to identify and report uploads that stop progressing
     - Memory monitoring with warning and critical thresholds
     - Enhanced error classification with detailed error types
     - Graceful termination handling for clean process exits
     - Network latency measurement for diagnostics
     - Improved time remaining calculations
   - Impact: Dramatically improves reliability for large uploads in challenging network environments.

10. ✅ **Improve Error Objects** (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
   - Problem: Current error handling mainly logs messages but doesn't create structured error objects.
   - Solution: Implemented enhanced error classification in streaming uploads with:
     - Error type detection and classification (file_not_found, permission_denied, etc.)
     - Recoverability indicators to guide retry behavior
     - Additional context in error logs (file information, error codes)
   - Status: Completed for streaming uploads; could be extended to other parts of the system
   - Impact: Makes debugging easier, error handling more consistent, and improves diagnostics

11. **Add JSDoc Comments**
   - Problem: While there are some function comments, they aren't in JSDoc format which could help with IDE integration.
   - Solution: Convert comments to JSDoc format for better tooling support.
   - Impact: Improves developer experience and documentation.

12. **Consider Using ES Modules**
    - Problem: The codebase uses CommonJS modules, but ES modules would provide better encapsulation.
    - Solution: Consider migrating to ES modules for better code organization.
    - Impact: Long-term code organization improvement, but requires significant refactoring.
